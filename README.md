# Healthy-Foods
This is my simple and efficient React application where users can browse, add, and "buy" healthy food items. Built as a learning project, this app helped me explore the core concepts of React, including component structure, props, state management, event handling, and styling.
Whether you're just listing your favorite healthy meals or simulating a shopping cart experience, this project showcases how React can be used to create clean and interactive user interfaces.
